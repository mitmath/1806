Just download the notebook file (a `.ipynb` file) by clicking the download icon at the upper right, then drag it onto the JuliaBox dashboard to upload it there. (We will be using Julia version 1.0 or later). (Avoid the json format by downloading the link or at least having the ipynb extension.)\n",

To **run the code** in an input cell, **just click on the cell and then type shift-return**; see also the \"Help\" menu in the notebook. When we say, check, we are asking you to run the code, but not necessarily write anything.\n",

    "When you submit your pset, you may handwrite or type, but submit **clearly labeled PDFs**.   (An app like Tiny Scanner for your phone makes it easier to scan black-and-white documents into legible PDF files using a cell-phone camera.) For printing a notebook to PDF, you may find that the Jupyter Download-as-PDF or printing *Print Preview* (in the *File* menu at the top of the notebook interface) produces a nicer file than directly printing from your browser."
