    "**(a)** Notice that $A$ only has one linearly independent column, so $C(A)$ is spanned by the vector $x_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$. We can then find the projection matrix $P_C$ using the simple formula for projecting onto a vector:\n",

    "\n",
    "**(b)** Similarly, the row space is one dimensional and is spanned by the vector $x_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.  We can then find the projection matrix $P_R$ using the simple formula for projecting onto a vector:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_R = \\frac{x_2 x_2^T}{x_2^T x_2} = \\frac{1}{9}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 2 \\\\  2 & 4 & 4 \\\\ 2 & 4 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \n",

    "We can then multiply $B = P_CAP_R$\n",

    "So even better than $P_CAP_R = A$, we have *both* that $P_CA = A$ and $AP_R = A$ (and then $P_CAP_R = A$ follows from these two).\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Why is $P_CA = A$?  Well, two matrices $M, N$ of the same size are equal if and only if $Mx = Nx$ for all possible column vectors $x$ so that the multiplication makes sense.  So to see that $P_CA = A$, we only need to see that $P_CAx = Ax$ for any vector $x$; but $Ax$ is in the column space $C(A)$, so it's projection $P_CAx$ is itself, i.e. $P_CAx = Ax$.  So $P_CA = A$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Similarly, to check that $AP_R = A$ we can just check that $AP_Rx = P_Rx$ for all possible $x$.  Any $x$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (let's say that $A$ is $m \\times n$ can be written in the form $x = x_n + x_r$ with $x_n$ in the nullspace and $x_r$ in the row space of $A$ (because these spaces are orthogonal complements).  So it's enough to check that $AP_Rx_r = Ax_r$ and $AP_rx_n = Ax_n$.  In the first case, we have $P_Rx_r = x_r$ by definition of projection, so indeed $AP_Rx_r = Ax_r$.  In the second case, we have $P_Rx_n = 0$ because $N(A)$ and $C(A^T)$ are orthogonal; as $Ax_n = 0$ as well by the definition of nullspace, we have $AP_Rx_n = Ax_n (= 0)$.  So $AP_Rx = Ax$ for all $x$, so $AP_R = A$."
