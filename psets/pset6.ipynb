    "As in our derivation of $A^TAx=A^Tb$ from minimizing $\\Vert b - Ax\\Vert$, it is often useful to do calculus (derivatives and integrals) on vectors and matrices.  If you have a matrix $A$ that is a function $A(\\alpha)$ of some parameter $\\alpha$, then its derivative $dA/d\\alpha$ is just  $$\\frac{dA}{d\\alpha} = \\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{A(\\alpha+h)-A(\\alpha)}{h} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{da_{1,1}}{d\\alpha} & \\frac{da_{1,2}}{d\\alpha} & \\cdots \\\\ \\frac{da_{2,1}}{d\\alpha} & \\frac{da_{2,2}}{d\\alpha} & \\cdots \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots \\end{pmatrix},$$ the matrix of the ordinary derivatives of each entry $a_{i,j}$ of $A$.  Lots of rules immediately follow, e.g. it should be obvious that $\\frac{d(A^T)}{d\\alpha} = \\left(\\frac{dA}{d\\alpha}\\right)^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $C = AB$ ($A$ is $m \\times n$ and $B$ is $n \\times p$), then each entry $c_{i,j}$ of $C$ is $c_{i,j} = \\sum_{k=1}^n a_{i,k} b_{k,j}$ (see lecture 2, perspective 1).   From this, apply the usual 18.01 product rule etc. to find the product rule $\\frac{dC}{d\\alpha} = ???$ for matrices (where the entries of both A and B are functions of α).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suppose the invertible square matrix $A$ has entries that are a function of $\\alpha$.  If $x$ is the solution to $Ax=b$ (where b is a constant vector, independent of α), then\n",

    "  - Give a formula for $\\frac{d(A^{-1})}{d\\alpha}$.   (Hint: you get the columns of $A^{-1}$ by solving for $x$ with $b = e_1, e_2, \\ldots$.)  Your answer should be in terms of $A$, $A^{-1}$, $dA/d\\alpha$, $b$, and/or combinations thereof."
