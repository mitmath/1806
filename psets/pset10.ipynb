    "In class, we saw that $o = [1,1,\\ldots,1,1]$ is an eigenvector of $M^T$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda = 1$ for any Markov matrix $M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** If $x_k$ is an eigenvector of $M$ ($M x_k = \\lambda_k x_k$) for any *other* eigenvalue $\\lambda_k \\ne 1$ of $M$, show that we must have $o^T x_k = 0$: it must be *orthogonal* to $o$.  (Hint: use $o^T = o^T M$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** Check your result from (a) numerically for a random $5 \\times 5$ Markov matrix `M = rand(5,5); M = M ./ sum(M, dims=1)`, with eigenvalues `eigvals(M)` and eigenvectors `X = eigvecs(M)`.   (Do `using LinearAlgebra` to get `eigvecs` and `eigvals`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: if you have a long vector `v`, Julia only shows a few elements by default, but you can show all the elements with `@show v`.  You can also look at the absolute values of the elements with `abs.(v)`, which can be easier to read than complex numbers in checking that entries are small.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**(c)** If we expand an arbitrary $x$ in an eigenvector basis $x = c_1 x_1 + \\cdots + c_m x_m$, letting $x_m$ be a steady-state eigenvector ($\\lambda_m = 1$) and supposing all of the other eigenvalues are $\\ne 1$, show that $o^T x$ gives us a simple formula for $c_m = \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(d)** Hence, if all other eigenvalues have magnitude $<1$, then $M^n x \\to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_$ (simple formula in $o,x,x_m$) as $n \\to \\infty$.   Check this formula against `M^100 * [1,2,3,4,5]` for your `M` from (b)."

Double-check your answer by looking at $A^{100}$ and $B^{100}$ in Julia — these are approaching matrices of rank \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, respectively.\n",
